This is just crazy to me.
Following a tutorial by Lynn Fisher, who does amazing "one div"/"single div" artwork, I created this pumpkin. It even has an animation!
Very cool stuff.
I added the little message box with because I wanted to add a inset shadow to it because I totally forgot about doing an inset shadow until this tutorial, ðŸ˜Š.
